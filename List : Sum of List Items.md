# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Pythonâ€™s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program

```
 L=[153,147,124,102] 
print(sum(L)))
```


## Output
![439296928-d732e3a8-dadb-4ab4-91c7-c4c18b31bd03](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f12d15bd-5c90-4b1a-a666-bf72f8e37693)

## Result
Thus, the program has been executed successfully.
